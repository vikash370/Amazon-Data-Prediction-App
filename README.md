Predicting Amazon Delivery Times: A Machine Learning Project
1. Project Overview
This project aims to predict the time it takes for an Amazon delivery to be completed, from the store to the drop-off location. The primary goal is to build a reliable regression model and deploy it as an interactive web application. This tool can help in estimating delivery logistics, improving efficiency, and providing customers with more accurate delivery timeframes. The project follows a complete data science workflow, including data preparation, feature engineering, model training, and application deployment using Streamlit.

2. Project Structure
The project is organized into a clear and logical structure to ensure reproducibility and ease of use.

3. Implementation and Methodology
The project was executed in several systematic phases:

A. Data Preparation and Cleaning
The initial step involved loading the amazon_delivery.csv dataset. The data was cleaned to handle inconsistencies and prepare it for analysis. Key actions included:

Removing Duplicates: Ensured that each record in the dataset was unique.

Handling Missing Values: Used SimpleImputer within our model pipeline to fill any missing numerical data (like Agent_Age and Agent_Rating) with the mean of the column.

Standardizing Data: Trimmed leading/trailing whitespaces from categorical columns (e.g., Weather, Traffic) to ensure consistency.

B. Feature Engineering
To improve the predictive power of our model, several new features were created from the existing data:

Geospatial Distance (Distance_km): Calculated the Haversine distance (straight-line distance on a sphere) between the store and drop-off coordinates. This is a critical predictor for delivery time.

Time-Based Features (Order_Hour): Extracted the hour from the Order_Time to capture time-of-day patterns that might affect traffic and delivery speed.

C. Model Development and Evaluation
A Gradient Boosting Regressor was selected for the final model due to its high performance and ability to handle complex relationships in the data. The model was trained on the preprocessed dataset.

The entire workflow, from data imputation and encoding to model training, was encapsulated in a Scikit-learn Pipeline. This ensures that the same preprocessing steps are applied consistently during both training and prediction, preventing data leakage and errors.

D. Application Development with Streamlit
A user-friendly web application was built using the Streamlit framework. The application (streamlit_app.py) provides a simple interface where users can input order details and receive an instant delivery time prediction.

Key Features of the App:

Interactive Inputs: Sliders, number inputs, and select boxes for all relevant features (e.g., agent rating, distance, weather, traffic).

Real-Time Prediction: Loads the pre-trained delivery_time_model.pkl and uses it to predict the delivery time based on user input.

User-Friendly Interface: A clean and organized layout for a seamless user experience.

4. Results and Conclusion
The project successfully delivered a functional and accurate tool for predicting Amazon delivery times. The final Gradient Boosting model provides reliable predictions based on a variety of factors. The Streamlit application effectively bridges the gap between the complex machine learning model and a practical, usable end product. This project serves as a strong proof-of-concept for applying machine learning to solve real-world logistics challenges.
